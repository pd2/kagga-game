I developed a inference game as a web app. One can test their reasoning skills on an English transliterated verse from 'Mankuthimmana Kagga', an book of pithy sayings written by DV Gundappa in Kannada language. When the player gets it right using the meaning of the kagga, they see their speed and number of tries it took them. 

Try this game on a desktop for best results.
